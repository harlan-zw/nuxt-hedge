## Introduction

Sometimes we're dealing with complex page structures which make it difficult to set SEO meta tags appropriately without
duplication.

To get around this, you can use build-time [Route Rules](https://nitro.unjs.io/config#routerules) to set dynamic SEO meta tags. This is useful for setting up default meta tags for a specific set of pages, such as a blog or product pages.

## Usage

Due to the performance implications, route rules are injected within the server runtime based on the route. This means that the properties will not update on client-side navigation,
you should only use this for data needed by crawlers.

Trying to set default OG Images? Try instead use the [App Icons - Open Graph Images](/docs/seo-utils/guides/open-graph-images#opengraph-image).

### `seoMeta`{lang="ts"}

Takes the same input as [useSeoMeta()](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-seo-meta#useseometa){lang="ts"}.

#description
Nuxt SEO Utils loads the [Infer SEO Meta Plugin](https://unhead.unjs.io/plugins/plugins/infer-seo-meta-tags) from [Unhead](https://unhead.unjs.io/) that will automatically infer SEO meta tags for you based on your content, including `og:title`, `og:description`, `twitter:card`.
::


```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/blog/**': {
      seoMeta: {
        author: 'Harlan Wilton',
      },
    },
  }
})
```

### `head`{lang="ts"}

Takes the same input as [useHead()](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-seo-meta#useseometa){lang="ts"}.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/blog/**': {
      head: {
        // set default icon for blog posts
        link: [
          { rel: 'icon', type: 'image/png', href: '/blog-icon.png' }
        ]
      },
    },
  }
})
```


## Limitations

Route rules will by default take a `high` priority, meaning that they will override any other meta tags set by the page. You can
override 

```vue [pages/blog/_slug.vue]
<script lang="ts" setup>
useSeoMeta({
  description: 'My awesome blog post',
}, {
  tagPriority: 'high' // overrides route rules
})
</script>
```
